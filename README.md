                                                         ðŸŒŠSmart Water Flow Monitoring System
                                                         
   This project demonstrates a simple yet effective setup to monitor water flow using a flow sensor connected to an ESP32 microcontroller. The system measures the rate at which water flows through a pipe, making it ideal for applications such as water usage monitoring, smart metering, and leak detection.
By capturing pulse signals from the water flow sensor, the ESP32 can calculate the flow rate and total volume of water that has passed through. This setup provides a foundation for developing intelligent water management systems for both residential and agricultural use.

    Component	                       Function
1) Water Flow Sensor        	Detects the rate of water flow by generating electrical pulses proportional to the flow.
2) ESP32 Microcontroller    	Reads pulses from the flow sensor, processes the data, and can display/log/act upon the flow readings.
